#CS 262 - Lab #2
This lab is based on [Lab 2](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/02management/lab.html)

I had to make an app that would take in a Name and a button that would increment their
age (starting at 0) and add that new age to a flatlist beneath the button.

Answer to the lab questions:
* clickHandler is the name of the component
* 'age' is a state component and placeholder is a prop component. You can change the former but not the latter
* Curly braces are used to get html variables
* An anonymous function is used to set the name
* No, it's all javascript
