1.1A - Workout app that recommends workout routine based on available equipment, whether the outdoors are available, etc. For example I could put down that I have access to dumbells, a staircase of three flights of stairs and a 30 minute time limit. From there the app could generate a half-hour workout routine that involves either the dumbells, the stairs or both.

1.1B - Uber-style food co-op app. Using the app a person could sign up to either set up a co-op station or to be a customer. From the app a homesteader could list available produce online and customers would get a listing of nearby co-ops and their available produce. The app could also be used to exchange produce for money, cryptocurrency or possibly other procude. Of course this whole idea lives and dies on homesteading in the area or lack thereof.
